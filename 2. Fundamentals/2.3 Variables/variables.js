    RULES:
    The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
    The first character must not be a digit.
    Case matters
    Non-Latin letters are allowed, but not recommended
    There is a list of reserved words, which cannot be used as variable names because they are used by the language itself.
    Normally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value without using let. This still works now if we donâ€™t put use strict in our scripts to maintain compatibility with old scripts.

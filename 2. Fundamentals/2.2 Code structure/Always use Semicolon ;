In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!
But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.

This not work without semicolon:
alert("Hello")
[1, 2].forEach(alert);

Because the engine interprete:
alert("Hello")[1, 2].forEach(alert);

If src is set, the script content is ignored.
A single <script> tag can’t have both the src attribute and code inside.

This won’t work:
<script src="file.js">
  alert(1); // the content is ignored, because src is set
</script>

We must choose either an external <script src="…"> or a regular <script> with code.

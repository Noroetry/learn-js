This was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It added new features to the language and modified some of the existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default. You need to explicitly enable them with a special directive: "use strict".

The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

"use strict";

Ensure that “use strict” is at the top
Please make sure that "use strict" is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.

There’s no way to cancel use strict
There is no directive like "no use strict" that reverts the engine to old behavior.
Once we enter strict mode, there’s no going back

So, for now "use strict"; is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it.
